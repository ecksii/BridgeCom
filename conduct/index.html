                    <p1>Inappropriate photography or recordings. Ask before taking photos or videos of people, especially if in a state of undress. People might feel fine expressing themselves at BridgeCom in certain aspects but probably do not want photographic evidence of such making its way out into the default world.</p1>

                <li>
                    <p1>Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someoneâ€™s consent before touching them.</p1>

                <li>
                    <p1>Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person). If you harass someone at an event you will be asked to leave.</p1>

                <li>
                    <p1>Sustained disruption of community events, including talks, workshops or presentations, will result in members being asked to leave.</p1>

            <h3>
               Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour is unacceptable. 
            </h3>

            <h2>Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour</h2>
            <h3>Unacceptable behaviour from any member of the BridgeCom community, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.</h3>
            <p1><br>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply <strong>immediately.</strong></p1>
            <p1><br>If a community member engages in unacceptable behaviour, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, this may range from being asked to leave an event up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from future events without warning. Note that any money given towards the event is on a donation basis, and will not be refunded.</p1>
            
            <h2>No Photos</h2>
            <p1>BridgeCom is a safe space for freedom of expression, on this basis we ask that <strong> no photos </strong> be taken without the express consent of those involved. Note that a small number of pictures may be taken by the event organisers for use in promoting future BridgeCom events, where possible these will not contain any identifying features and permission will be sought before these are published.</p1>
            <h2>Fire Zones</h2>
            <h3>Please ensure you donâ€™t start any fires!</h3> <p1>...unless you are fire lead or have their permission - if you think youâ€™ll want to get involved with the fires, contact us at info@bridgecom.uk and we can make that happen! We hope to have an effigy burn, where we expect everyone to comply with the requests of the fire lead. We may well have some fire pits, please act responsibly around these. <br><br>We want everyone to have a fun and safe BridgeCom!</p1>
            <h2>Illegal Activity</h2>
            <p1>BridgeCom is its own space, where we encourage people to enjoy themselves, however it still exists as a bubble in the default world, and so the law still applies. Please donâ€™t break the law.</p1>
            <h2>Vegan Site</h2>
            <p1>The wonderful hosts of our site are clear that this should be a <strong>plant based event</strong>, please respect their wishes and donâ€™t bring any dairy/animal products on site. If you want to know more please contact us ðŸ™‚</p1>
            <h2>Guests</h2>
            <p1>Unnamed guests will not be allowed access to the event site. Every person must register for their own ticket or they will not be allowed entry to the site. This helps keep everyone safe and helps us make sure we are planning for the correct number of attendees.</p1>
