            <h1>The 11 Burner Principles</h1>
            <h2> This event is run following the 11 principles of burning nest and other regional burns.
            <br><br>
            These are what defines any Burn, they are open to interpretation, and every Burner (that’s you!) applies and expresses them slightly differently, 
            the important thing is to try and apply them yourself, and to be patient with others who are doing the same!
            <br>
            These principles are important to us and our community, so please take some time to read and understand them.

                        This is key to making our event a safe and fun place – everyone is expected to check before a hug, or anything else! As a guideline remember FIRES. Consent should be:
